Groupwork 2
-----------

Procedure:
1. Register your group on Moodle. Same group members as for the first group work.
2. Download the pcap trace file corresponding to your group number. You can uncompress it with gunzip.
3. Download this text file and answer the questions below.
4. Upload your solution (i.e. this text file with your answers) to Moodle by
   one member of your group.

The pcap file contains the network traffic of a small company network with a few
clients and servers. There are also hosts that access the company servers from
outside (i.e. the Internet). The company network has a /16 address.

Note that the pcap file does not contain useable packet payload and all IP addresses
have been randomly generated. You should therefore focus on the packet headers.
You are free to use whatever tool you like to analyze the pcap file. Wireshark
might be a good choice if you are not familar with command line tools.
